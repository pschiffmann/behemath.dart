# mathlite

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a great language for source code documentation. One feature that it misses though is math support.
There are numerous projects that can parse embedded TeX macros in markdown files and compile them to MathML or other output formats.
However, this approach lacks one feature that I really like about markdown: You don't need to compile markdown to be readable.

Instead, I'd like to use the rich set of [unicode symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_operators_and_symbols_in_Unicode) and a monospace font to write math equations that resemble the final output as far as possible. You can find examples in the file [web/index.html]().

This library is an experimental parser for this format.

The name _mathlite_ is work in progress.
